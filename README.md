# My Personal Website

This is a website I made to serve as a hub for all of my online activities.  
I plan to continually update this project as time goes on.

Chinese was my minor in college and learning it is a hobby of mine, and so I've chosen to have it as a language option to practice my translations.  

If you have any questions about the site or myself feel free to contact me.  

Thanks for checking out my work.
