My Personal Website



<img src="content/gif/website.gif" width="700" height="450">


This is a website I made to serve as a hub for all of my online activities.  
I hope to continue to update this site as time goes on.  
Chinese was my minor in college and learning it is a hobby of mine, and therefore is a language option on the site.  
If you have any questions about the site or myself feel free to send me a message.  

You can visit my site at https://seanmyers.xyz!  

### TODO
* Finish the projects page layout.
* Translate the about page and possibly update it's content.
* Write a blog post about my website.
* Create a dark mode.
* TBD...
